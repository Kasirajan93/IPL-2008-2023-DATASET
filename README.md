IPL(2008-2023) DATASET CAPTURES RICH HISTORY AND PERFORMANCE METRICS OF MEN'S INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE.
THIS COMPREHENSIVE DATASET SERVING AS A GOLDMINE FOR SPORT ANALYTICS,MACHINE LEARNING MODELING, AND STRATEGIC INSIGHTS.


Dataset Structure:
#match_info

-Rows: 1,025

-Columns: 18

Description:

This table contains high-level metadata for each IPL match. It includes details such as:

~Match ID

~Season/year

~Teams involved

~Venue

~Toss decisions

~Match result (win/loss/no result)

~Winning team and margin

~Match date and city

Ideal for match-level analysis, win trends, toss effect, team dominance, home-ground advantage, etc.

#match_data

-Rows: 243,818

-Columns: 23

Description:

This granular-level table logs ball-by-ball events, offering rich context per delivery. It includes:

~Match ID (to connect with match_info)

~Over and ball number


~Batting and bowling team

~Striker and non-striker

~Bowler

~Runs scored

~Wickets (type, fielder, etc.)

~Extra runs (wide, no-ball, leg-bye, etc.)

Ideal for in-depth player performance analysis, building prediction models (e.g., run prediction, player rating), and game simulations.



Iâ€™ve identified this as a supervised classification problem, which is correct for use cases such as:

      # Predicting match outcomes (win/loss);

      #  Classifying batsmen/bowlers based on performance tiers;

      #  Toss decision analysis;

      #  Predicting player of the match;

      #  Umpire decision classifications;

We can also explore regression tasks (e.g., predicting total match score) or time-series modeling (e.g., momentum shifts over overs).
